<p>8.19.2022/started the website</p>
<p>8.24.22/today the website went live</p>
<p>8,25.22 I forgot what happend today</p>
<p>9.2.22 this week I learned How to cad, how to code in java, and how to cut into objects in cad</p>
<p>9.8.22 today we completed the cad for the rube goldberg machine</p>
<p>Also we added two baloons :/</p>
<p>9.26.22 this week we completed our rub goldberg machines(see pictures below) as well as doing a paper boat competiton </p>
<p>9.30.22 This week we created a animal prosthetic in tinker cad and harrassed subs</p>
<p>10.7.22 Today (and the days before this day) hase been generally hectic and loud</p> <br> <p>We have finished disecting the laptops and are now going to be putting them back together</p>
<p>10.24.22 For the past week I have been absent, however The rocket launch did not go to plan and we encounterd some issues.<br> the rocket spun out of controll and landed behind the mark. <br> A good learning experience.<p/> 
<p>11.4.22 This week weve been focusing on breadboarding and electrical engineering. weve learned how to route wires, resisters, and leds. <br>at the end of the lessons we will be doing aurdino </p>
<p>11.10.22 This week we did breadboarding. We wired leds leds through resistor in order to prevent it from blowing up</p>
<p>11.18.22 throught the past week we have been breadbording and wiring leds with aurdino.</p>
<p>We wired out leds leds to go off in differnt order<p/>
<p>12.2.22 We have begun our final project, a spagetti bridge.<b> My group has chosen to build our bidge using segments reinforced but cut yp segments of speggeti in the the shape of an X (see picture below)</p>
<p>12.15.22 These past three weeks we have been building a spagetti bridge theat can hold water hold by a bucket attached on two parts of the bridge<b>Throughout this experience we have learned many lessons they are listed as the following 1. do not over glue as it makes your bridge less solid <b> 
2.do not use tape to secure your bridge limbs, <b> 3. do not under any circumstances ever rely on the glue to set correctly (it will not)<b>
 we have gone through many itteration of our bridge we started with a wide desighn with many x's used to support the entire thing. <b>
  and we are ending with a thin design made long with triangles aimed against each other (see pictures below) </p>

  <p>1.13.23 for our first week back we have been focused on the business side of engineering.<b>So for our project we were tasked with creating and selling a product to a group of suido shark judges. <b> Me and my parteners idea so far has been the Automatic finger nail cutter.<b>The main way our product will function is using a medical cast saw.<b>We chose this saw because of its capacity to cut hard matter with out cutting soft skin matter.<p/>
<p>1.20.23 I am sick and am out of school, however the work we were on was was the finacial side of engineering Me and my partner decided on the idea of the automatic nail cutter. <b> with our product we have decided to price it cheap and try and cement it into the routines of our users.  <b>thus creating a constant flow of money and having our value continually over time.</p>
<p>1.27.23 I just got back after a week. My partener did the presentaion and we have started a new project on the engineering procces for either a small car or a campus wide survay.</p>
<p>2.3.23 Currently we are getting ready for the apex of our engineering project. For mine I am building a mouse trap car.<b>for my project I still have to complete my proposal and BOM, as well as my tinker cad desighn of the whole thing.</b>
</p>
<p>2.10.23 This week we have been working on finalizing the plans of our project mine being a mouse trap car (see pictures of cad below(It may not show due to technical difficulties)). In addition we also had a chalenge day in which we were tasked with transporting a baloon as fast as possible only using a meter stick, rubber bands, and popsicle sticks. our had a good desighn but our runner felt like walking so we got close to last place (see veideo and picture below)</p>
 <p>2.17.23 this week while I have been catching up on some procrastination I began building my project</p>
 <p>3.3.23 Ive missed a few website updates, Ive built the mouse trap car (see below) It didnt work and while my desighn of the body was pretty good, the mexhanism I used to move forward didnt work.  The reason for this is because of impropper placement of the wire as well as a lacking amount of support for the wheele. (I will provide a video and picture when I can as I can upload it from my phone atm)                                                            <ssaaaaaswwwwww>                        </ssaaaaaswwwwww>              </p>

 <p>3.10.23 This last week before Spring brake we have mainly been doing nothing as its going to pick up after the break. On thursday we had our gutter boat chalenge and I made a small craft that was made to be lightweight and the sail was angled and attached to it(see below) </p>
<p>4.7.23 *UPDATE FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS* For the past two weeks have been odd. I have been absent for the first one and I only just came back this week. I was sick with a nasty ailment (the working theory is strep throat)  Throughout the time I was out of school I was unable move, eat, or do any work. So I was unaware of the project we were doing in the mean time. We are making a boat out of cardboard and duck tape. Our Idea is going to be a boat balists made of cardboard.</p>
<p>4.14.23 Me and my group have been working on a boat desighn. Our desighn is two boats side by side connected together with cardbaord supports (see pictures below). I was supposed to add a video of my egg drop however when we did that I was absent.</p>
